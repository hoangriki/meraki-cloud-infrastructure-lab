Meraki Cloud Infrastructure Lab

Hands-on lab documentation and structured study notes from the Cisco Meraki cloud networking course.
This repository focuses on real-world cloud-managed network deployments using Cisco Meraki MX, MS, MR, and Systems Manager.

Overview

This project documents my practical implementation and configuration of:

Meraki Dashboard administration

MX Security & SD-WAN appliances

MS Layer 2 switching

MR Wireless access points

VLAN architecture & segmentation

Firewall rules & traffic shaping

Site-to-site VPN configuration

Systems Manager (MDM)

The goal of this repository is to build strong cloud-managed infrastructure fundamentals that align with modern DevOps and cloud engineering practices.
